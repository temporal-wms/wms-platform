    AsyncAPI specification for Inventory Service domain events.

    The Inventory service publishes events to track stock level changes across the warehouse.
    Events follow the CloudEvents 1.0 specification.

    **Event Flow:**
    1. InventoryItemCreated - When a new SKU is onboarded
    2. InventoryReceived - When new stock arrives
    3. InventoryReserved - When stock is allocated to an order
    4. InventoryReleased - When reserved stock is released
    5. InventoryPicked - When stock is physically picked
    6. InventoryAdjusted - When quantities are corrected
    7. LowStockAlert - When stock falls below reorder point
    8. LowStockCleared - When stock is replenished above reorder point

    **Integration:**
    - Order service listens for InventoryReserved to confirm allocation
    - Picking service listens for reservation events
    - Procurement/replenishment systems listen for LowStockAlert
    - WES listens for inventory events during workflow execution
